  <p>Hello and Welcome,</p>
  <p>My name is Austin Hauck. I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2019 with a Bachlors in Business Administration,
    concentration in Marketing, and a Minor in General Psychology. Currently I am taking the Data Analytics Bootcamp from UO
    where I am learning languages such has Python, SQL, HTML, and more.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>As for work, I used to drive for Uber & Lyft full time. Since the Pandemic and the lockdowns I have been working for Instacart.
    For those that don't know what Instacart is, its a personal shopping app where someone else (like me) will do your grochery for you.
    This is super handy for those that are in the high risk group or those that don't have the time to go to the store.
